中文版：zhihu

Human Pose Estimation: the problem of localization of human joints (or) keypoints (regression problem)

- RGB or RGBD
- lmage or video
- Monocular or multiple view
- Single person or multiple person
- 2D or 3D pose estimation
- 3D pose or 3D shape



## 2D Pose Estimation

### Task

- Single-Person Skeleton Estimation

  - Benchmark: MPII (2014)
  - Representative work: CPM (CVPR 2016), Hourglass (ECCV 2016)

- Multi-person Pose Estimation

  - Benchmark: COCO (2016), CrowdPose (2018)
  - Bottom-up: OpenPose (CVPR 2017), Associative Embedding (NIPS 2017)
  - Top-down: CPN (CVPR 2018), MSPN (Arxiv 2018), HRNet (CVPR 2019)

- Video Pose Tracking

  - Benchmark: PoseTrack (2017)
  - Representative work: Simple Baselines (ECCV 2018)

### Challenge

- Occlusion
- Complex background
- Special pose

## 3D Pose Estimation 

### Problem

- Estimate a 3D pose (x,y,z) coordinates from a RGB image or video (regression problem)
- Input:  an image of a person
- Output: 3D human pose that matches the spatial position (N×3 key points)

### Challenge

- Larger 3D pose space and self-occlusions
- Depth ambiguity, ill-posed nature (multiple 3D poses can map to the same 2D keypoints)
- Lack of a larger 3D pose dataset in the wild (major bottleneck)
  - Lack of a special pose dataset (tumbling, rolling)
  - Obtain a 3D pose dataset is diﬃcult and expensive (require a complicated laboratory setup with motion capture sensors and cameras)
  - Limit their generalizability due to the constrained lab environment)

### Application

- Animation, gaming
- Motion capture system
- Action understanding
- Provide a auxiliary to other task (Person-reID, Action recognition)
- Multi-task learning (Human parsing)

### Method

- Directly regress the 3D poses from monocular images

  - 3D Human Pose Estimation from Monocular Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ACCV 2014)
  - Coarse-to-Fine Volumetric Prediction for Single-Image 3D Human Pose（Volumetric representation, 3D heatmaps) (CVPR 2017)
- Joint 2D and 3D: lift 3D pose from the estimated 2D joint position
  - Compositional Human Pose Regsression (ICCV 2017)
  - Towards 3D Human Pose Estimation in the Wild (ICCV 2017)
  - Both categories require sophisticated deep network architectures and abundant annotated training samples. 
- 3D pose estimation using only 2D joint detections as input
  - 3D Pose Estimation = 2D Pose Estimation + Matching (CVPR 2017)
  - Simple Yet Effective Baseline (ICCV 2017)
  - Advantages
    - For 2D pose, existing large-scale datasets have provided sufﬁcient annotations. Pre-trained 2D pose estimators are mature enough to be deployed elsewhere. 
    - For 2D to 3D reconstruction, inﬁnite 2D-3D pose pairs can be generated by projecting each 3D pose into 2D poses under different camera views.

### Benchmark

- Human3.6M (2014)
  - The largest publicly available dataset for 3D human pose estimation
  - 3.6 million video frames, 4 different viewpoints
  - 15 actions: directions, discussion, eating, greeting, phoning, posing, purchases, sitting, sitting down, smoking, taking photo, waiting, walking, walking dog, walking together
  - 11 subjects, 7 professional actors are annotated with 3D poses
    - Training: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 (1559752 samples)
    - Testing: 9, 11 (550644 samples)
- HumanEva (2010)
- MPI-INF-3DHP (2017)

### Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE): Protocol 1
  - Mean of per joint Euclidean distance between ground truth and prediction for all joints 
- Procrustes analysis MPJPE (P-MPJPE): Protocol 2
  - Error after alignment with the ground truth in translation, rotation, and scale
- Percentage of Correct Key-points (PCK)
  - Detected joint is considered correct if the distance between the predicted and the true joint is within a certain threshold
- Percentage of Correct Parts (PCP)
  - A limb is considered detected and a correct part if the distance between the two predicted joint locations and the true limb joint locations is at most half of the limb length (PCP at 0.5 )

### Supervised Method

- Weakly-Supervised
  - Depth、Point cloud、Mesh、GAN、Reprojection the 3D to 2D
- Semi-supervised
  - Reprojection the 3D to 2D
- Self-Supervised 
- Fully-Supervised

### Video

- Direct estimation of 3D pose from disjointed images leads to temporally incoherent output with visible jitters and varying bone lengths. 
- The  future frames can benefit from past video information about human poses. This is beneficial when the pose of a person is ambiguous or the body is partially occluded in a given frame. Here, past information can help resolve and con- strain the pose estimate.
